How to Use the RideApp Project  

Thank you for claiming this project! Follow the steps below to set up the project.  

Client Setup:  

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.  
2. Open the Universal Search in VS Code and replace all instances of `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY` with your actual API key.  
3. Next, go to the `app.json` file and change the `bundleIdentifier` from `com.ritik.rideapp` to your preferred identifier.  
4. Run the following command to install dependencies:  
   
   npm install --force
   
5. Install Expo EAS CLI and log in to your Expo account:  
   
   npm install -g eas-cli
   eas login
   
6. Run the following command to prebuild the project:  
   
   npx expo prebuild
   
7. If using a real device, update the API URLs in the client configuration:  
   - Open `src/service/config.js` and modify the `BASE_URL` and `SOCKET_URL` to use your local network IP or hosted URL.  

   Example:  

   import { Platform } from "react-native";

   export const BASE_URL = Platform.OS === 'ios' ?
       'http://localhost:3000' :
       'http://10.0.2.2:3000';

   export const SOCKET_URL = Platform.OS === 'ios' ?
       'ws://localhost:3000' :
       'ws://10.0.2.2:3000';

   // USE YOUR NETWORK IP OR HOSTED URL
   // export const BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.xx.xxx:3000';
   // export const SOCKET_URL = 'ws://192.168.xx.xxx:3000';
   
8. Finally, run the app for iOS or Android:  
   - For iOS:  
     
     npm run ios
     
   - For Android:  
     
     npm run android
     



Server Setup:  

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.  
2. Rename the `env_template` file to `.env`.  
3. Open the `.env` file and update your credentials, such as the Mongo URI and other configurations.  
4. The server is configured to run on all IP addresses (`0.0.0.0`), which allows access from other devices on the same WiFi network. This is handled in `app.js`:  

   
   server.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, "0.0.0.0", () => {
       console.log(`Server running on port ${process.env.PORT || 3000}`);
   });
   
5. Install the server dependencies:  
   
   npm install --force
   
6. Start the server by running:  
   
   npm start
